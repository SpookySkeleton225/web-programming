	<h1> Basic Concepts of Web Technology </h1>
		<h2>Define HTML:</h2>
			<h3>A markup language made up of tags, used to indicate different parts of an internet page.</h3>
		<h2>Define the Client-server model of communications.</h2>
			<h3>Client server communication happens between a Server which waits for requests from a Client. This is known as a Request-Response loop. Often the requests are for resources used in a web page.</h3>
		<h2>Write down the name of different types of servers:</h2>
			<h3>Data Servers, Application Servers, Authentication Servers, Email Servers, Web Servers and Media Servers are all types of servers used across the internet.</h3>
		<h2>Define a Web Server:</h2>
			<h3>A computer designed specifically to respond to HTTP requests.</h3>
		<h2>Define Data Centers:</h2>
			<h3>A Data Center is a location that stores Server Farms which are large collections of servers. They are climate controlled with lots of spare power sources to prevent blackouts.</h3>
		<h2>Why do we need a Uniform Resource Locator (URL)?</h2>
			<h3>A URL provides a way for clients to get specific resources from a server, containing the path for the pages resources.</h3>
		<h2>Give an example of Uniform Resource Locator (URL) and specify all components of a URL:</h2>
			<h3>"http://www.funwebdev.com/index.php?page=17#article"
				"protocol://domain/path?QueryString#fragment"
				Protocol is the web protocol used in the web page, Domain is the domain of the website, Path is the path to the website, Query strings are ways of passing information, and the fragment is a location within the resource.</h3>
		<h2>What is the difference between a static and a dynamic web site?</h2>
			<h3>A static website is an website consisting of only HTML pages that look the same for every user. A dynamic website can have data from many different sources, and can look different for each user.</h3>
		<h2>Why do we need Domain Name System (DNS)? </h2>
			<h3>Humans do not typically enjoy memorizing long strings of numbers, so the Domain Name Systems are used to make finding and remembering websites easier.</h3>
		<h2>Describe in detail the process of DNS address resolution:</h2>
			<h3>First the host device checks if the IP for the website the user wants to visit is in the browers cache. If it's not it checks the operating systems DNS cache. Followed by the ISP's DNS cache if it is still not found. Then it will request the IP from the root name server, beginning a Request-Response loop untill the websites IP is sent back to the client.</h3>
		<h2>Give some examples of generic top-Level domains (gTLD):</h2>
			<h3>.com, .net, .org, .gov, .edu</h3>
		<h2>Give some examples of country code top-Level domains (ccTLD):</h2>
			<h3>.ca, .uk, .us, .fr, .in, .ru</h3>
		<h2>How can you pass a users information from the client to the web server?</h2>
			<h3>User informaton is passed with Query Strings. They are encoded as pairs sperated by ? and &. Example: ?username=john&password=abcdefg</h3>
		<h2>What is the function (purpose) of Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)?</h2>
			<h3>HTTP establishes a connection between a User and a Server.</h3>
		<h2>Describe how a single web page is displayed on a web browser.</h2>
			<h3>First the Client requests the inital HTML page, then goes through the HTML code to return the resources referenced within it. Once everything is retrived the page is loaded.</h3>
		<h2>Give some examples of HTTP request methods:</h2>
			<h3>GET, POST, HEAD</h3>
